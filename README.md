This is an opinionated [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) Starter app.
Basically it's all the thing I like when starting a new project.

It's more for my personal use than anything else but feel free to use it as you like.

## 💎 Cool stuff that uses

-   ▲ [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) as a React app
-   🎨 [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) for styling
-   💾 [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app) for data fetching
-   🔍 [Next SEO](https://github.com/garmeeh/next-seo) for SEO
-   ✏️ [Heroicons](https://heroicons.com/) for icons

### 🛠 Start Developing

With [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com) on a parent folder

```bash
gh repo clone nicoandrade/starter new-name
```

Install all dependencies with this command

```bash
npm install
```

After all dependencies are installed, you are ready to go, run this to start the app:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You will see the app running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
